/**
 * Captures a PNG screenshot of every Storybook story for visual acceptance review.
 *
 * Serves the pre-built static Storybook (`storybook-static/`) over a local HTTP
 * server, renders each story's iframe in real Chromium via Playwright, and
 * screenshots it to `screenshots/<id>.png`. Build Storybook first
 * (`pnpm build-storybook`); this script does not build.
 *
 * Output is written to a per-run directory with no shared resource, so it is
 * safe to upload as a CI artifact and never races across concurrent PR runs.
 *
 * Fail-fast, not time-out: a story is given a short render budget, stories are
 * captured concurrently, and the whole run has a wall-clock deadline (below the
 * CI job's `timeout-minutes`). On the deadline the script exits non-zero
 * immediately. This matters because a job that hits `timeout-minutes` is
 * *cancelled* (which the PR coordinator escalates to a human), whereas a
 * non-zero exit is a *failure* (auto-routed to fix-review). We want the latter.
 *
 * Exits 0 when every story was captured, 1 if the build output is missing, any
 * story failed to render, or the deadline was hit.
